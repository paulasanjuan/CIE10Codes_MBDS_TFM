various clinical elements such as diagnostics, medications, and observations. It doesn't have to contain all types of concepts, maybe the note is only about a diagnostic.\n","The note can contain zero, one or multiple concepts that are codifiable by the ICD-10 codes.\n","\n","By realistic, I mean that the note can contain few spelling mistakes, can lack overall structure and contain abbreviations and medical jargons.\n","The note should be quite short, one or two paragraphs maximum.\n","\n","Your task consist of generating a table accompanying the note. Each row in the table should represent a concept, featuring a text excerpt from the note in one column and the corresponding ICD-10 code in the other column.\n","Columns names are \"Text\" and \"ICD10\". This table should only include ICD-10 codes mentioned in the note. If there are no relevant rows (no relevant concepts in the note), the table should be empty.\n","This table should be returned in CSV format with quotations mark around the text except.\n","Don't invent any ICD-10 codes.\n","\n","To help you here is an example of what you should return. Please return something in the same format.\n","However the content should be completely different and should satisfy the above requirements.\n","Remember this is just an example to give you the format, pay very close attention to the requirements.\n","\n","\n","## EXAMPLES OF ANSWERS:\n","\n","### EXAMPLE 1:\n","#### Clinical note:\n","'The patient presents progressive weakness in the muscles of the extremities, especially in the arms and legs.'\n","#### ICD-10 Coding Table:\n","'Text', 'ICD10'\n","'progressive weakness in the muscles of the extremities', 'M62.81'\n","\n","### EXAMPLE 2:\n","#### Clinical Note:\n","Patient presented with persistent muscle weakness and generalized fatigue, noted over the last few months.
