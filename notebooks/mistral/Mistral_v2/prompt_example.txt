## Task Description
	
Your task is to create a small realistic clinical note for a patient diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The note should include various clinical elements such as diagnostics, medications, and observations. It doesn't have to contain all types of concepts, maybe the note is only about a diagnostic.

The note can contain zero, one or multiple concepts that are codifiable by the aforementioned ICD-10 codes. Most likely the note also includes concepts that are unrelated to ALS. By realistic, I mean that the note can contain few spelling mistakes, can lack overall structure and contain abbreviations and medical jargons. The note should be quite short, one or two paragraphs maximum.
	
Additionally, you should generate a table accompanying the note. Each row in the table should represent a concept related to ALS, featuring a text excerpt from the note in one column and the corresponding ICD-10 code in the other column. Columns names are "Text" and "ICD10". This table should only include ICD-10 codes mentioned in the note. If there are no relevant rows, the table should be empty. This table should be returned in CSV format with quotations mark around the text except. Don't invent any ICD-10 codes, only use the codes you see above.

To help you here is an example of what you should return. Please return something in the same format, that is clinical note than table. However the content should be completely different and should satisfy the above requirements. Remember this is just an example to give you the format, pay very close attention to the requirements.

## Example

### Clinical Note:
Patient presented with persistent muscle weakness and generalized fatigue, noted over the last few months. Complains of frequent muscle cramps and has experienced increasing difficulty in speaking, leading to anarthria. No signs of involuntary movements or facial weakness. Reports dysphagia, predominantly with solids, which has progressively worsened. The patient's motor coordination is also affected, with noted ataxia. Currently on Riluzole and Nuedexta to manage symptoms.
