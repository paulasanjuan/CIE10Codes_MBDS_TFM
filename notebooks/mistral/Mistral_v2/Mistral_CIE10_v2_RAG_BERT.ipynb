It doesn't have to contain all types of concepts, maybe the note is only about a diagnostic.\n","The note can contain zero, one or multiple concepts that are codifiable by the ICD-10 codes.\n","\n","By realistic, I mean that the note can contain few spelling mistakes, can lack overall structure and contain abbreviations and medical jargons.\n","The note should be quite short, one or two paragraphs maximum.\n","\n","Your task consist of generating a table accompanying the note. Each row in the table should represent a concept, featuring a text excerpt from the note in one column and the corresponding ICD-10 code in the other column.\n","Columns names are \"Text\" and \"ICD10\". This table should only include ICD-10 codes mentioned in the note. If there are no relevant rows (no relevant concepts in the note), the table should be empty.\n","This table should be returned in CSV format with quotations mark around the text except.\n","Don't invent any ICD-10 codes.\n","\n","To help you here is an example of what you should return.
